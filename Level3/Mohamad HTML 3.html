            <h2 id="mbappe">KYLIAN MBAPPÉ</h2>
            <p>Bondy's prodigal son returns to the cover of FIFA 22 after another record-breaking season at Paris
                Saint-Germain. Mbappé ended last season as the youngest player in Ligue 1 history to win the top scorer
                award three times in a row. That's our
                cover star.</p><br>
            <h2 id="foden">PHIL FODEN</h2>
            <p>Last season, Phil Foden let the world in on his generational talent with some stunning performances for
                Manchester City. The key difference maker in tight, title-defining games, Foden's unique talents have
                set him on the path to greatness.</p><br>
            <h2 id="arnold">TRENT ALEXANDER-ARNOLD</h2>
            <p>The first number 66 that kids want to be, Trent Alexander-Arnold's ascent into one of the world's best
                attacking right backs has been breathtaking to watch. Playing a key role in Liverpool's recent domestic
                and European triumphs, Trent has
                transformed what a right back should be. Off the pitch too, Trent's charitable work in his corner of the
                city embodies what football is all about.</p><br>
