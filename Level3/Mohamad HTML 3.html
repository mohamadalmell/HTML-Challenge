                <h2>Top Players</h2>
                <h3 id="mbappe">Kylian Mbappé</h3>
                <p>Bondy's prodigal son returns to the cover of FIFA 22 after another record-breaking season at Paris
                    Saint-Germain. Mbappé ended last season as the youngest player in Ligue 1 history to win the top
                    scorer award three times in a row. That's
                    our cover star.</p><br>
                <h3 id="foden">Phil Foden</h3>
                <p>Last season, Phil Foden let the world in on his generational talent with some stunning performances
                    for Manchester City. The key difference maker in tight, title-defining games, Foden's unique talents
                    have set him on the path to greatness.</p><br>
                <h3 id="arnold">Trent Alexander-Arnold</h3>
                <p>The first number 66 that kids want to be, Trent Alexander-Arnold's ascent into one of the world's
                    best attacking right backs has been breathtaking to watch. Playing a key role in Liverpool's recent
                    domestic and European triumphs, Trent
                    has transformed what a right back should be. Off the pitch too, Trent's charitable work in his
                    corner of the city embodies what football is all about.</p><br>
