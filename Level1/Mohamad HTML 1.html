        <h1><u><b>Earthquakes</b></u></h1>
    </header>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>An earthquake <em>(also known as a quake, tremor or temblor)</em> is the shaking of the surface of the Earth
        resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.
        <b>Earthquakes</b> can range insize from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough
        to propel objects and peopleinto the air, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismicity, or seismic
        activity, of an area is thefrequency, type, and size of <b>earthquakes</b> experienced over a period of time.
        The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.<br>
        At the Earth's surface, <b>earthquakes</b> manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the
        ground. Whenthe <q>epicenter</q> of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced
        sufficiently to cause a tsunami. <b>Earthquakes</b> can also trigger landslides and, occasionally, volcanic
        activity.<br>
        In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event<em>—whether natural or
            caused by humans—</em>that generates seismic waves. <b>Earthquakes</b> are caused mostly by rupture of
        geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear
        tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The <q>epicenter</q> is the
        point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.</p><br>
    <h2>Naturally occurring earthquakes</h2>
    <p>Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere in the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive
        fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically
        only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional
        resistance.</p>
    <h3>Earthquake fault types</h3>
    <p>There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust),
        and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is
        in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in
        areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Reverse faults occur in areas where the
        crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two
        sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip
        fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip;
        this is known as oblique slip.</p>
    <h3>Earthquakes away from plate boundaries</h3>
    <p>Where plate boundaries occur within the continental lithosphere, deformation is spread out over a much larger
        area than the plate boundary itself. In the case of the San Andreas fault continental transform, many
        earthquakes occur away from the plate boundary and are related to strains developed within the broader zone of
        deformation caused by major irregularities in the fault trace (e.g., the "Big bend" region). The Northridge
        earthquake was associated with movement on a blind thrust within such a zone. Another example is the strongly
        oblique convergent plate boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates where it runs through the northwestern
        part of the Zagros Mountains. The deformation associated with this plate boundary is partitioned into nearly
        pure thrust sense movements perpendicular to the boundary over a wide zone to the southwest and nearly pure
        strike-slip motion along the Main Recent Fault close to the actual plate boundary itself. This is demonstrated
        by earthquake focal mechanisms.</p>
